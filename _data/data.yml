    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Gabriel is a Phd. in Computer Engineering, data scientist and machine learning engineer. He is a experienced 
      developer in python, matlab, golang, c/c++, shellscript and GPU programming with CUDA. He is currently 
      working as a performance analytics engineer, defining and implementing a recommendation system for 
      Atrio Compousable Cloud. The technologies that Gabriel uses in his daily work include containers 
      (docker and singularity), different kind of databases, that is, relational (SQL), time series (influxdb) 
      and non-relational (MongoDB) as well as different data analysis and machine learning libraries such as 
      pandas, scikit-learn or matplotlib.  Gabriel received the PhD degree in Computer Engineering from the 
      University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain, in 2013. He has obtained several prices for his PhD. dissertation 
      such as the "Best Iberian PhD. Dissertation in Information System and Technologies" awarded by the 
      Iberian Association for Information Systems and Technologies, and the "Outstanding PhD Dissertation award"
      by the University of Extremadura.  He is interested in expanding his education into Big Data analysis with 
      Spark and cloud computing with certifications in AWS, GCP and Azure.
      He was a Predoctoral Research Associate (funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation) 
      with the Hyperspectral Computing Laboratory and Postdoctoral Researcher  in "Instituto de Telecomunicaçoes" 
      Lisbon, Portugal, where he developed of new techniques for unmixing and compressive sensing of 
      hyperspectral images, and performed research about efficient processing of these images in GPUs. He is
      co-author of a patent about a portable performance analytics system. He has authored or co-authored more
      than 60 publications, including several book chapters, journal citation report (JCR) papers and 
      peer-reviewed international conference papers. For a full detailed list of contributions please visit
